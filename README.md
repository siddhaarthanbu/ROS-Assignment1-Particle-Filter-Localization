# ROS-Assignment1-Particle-Filter-Localization
Implement a version of the particle filter (Monte Carlo Localization, MCL) algorithm for localization. You will use the map provided for the practice exercise in the socspioneer package. In addition to the steps of the particle filter (i.e., motion update, sensor update, and re-sampling),
